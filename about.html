    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Why I created this blog</h2>
    <p>I created this blog as I wanted a place to store all the techy thoughts I have in my brain, it was initially for
        me to unpack tasks that I have completed in my day job so all my process' and errors I encountered are in a nice
        format rather than just in my notes app on my phone, although it was quite organized with the features such as
        bullet check lists and formatting that is available on the notes app, there wasn't any code snippets on there
        which is arguably the most important part!</p>
    <p>Coincidentally around the the time I was starting this blog (I had originally started this blog on wix which
        crazily enough was harder than coding myself as you can probably tell form the basic styles that you can see,
        frontend and UX isn't my favorite, so using wix took all the enjoyable aspects such as backend and functionality
        out of the picture and left me with just the tedious work) I joined the BGT X Monzo mentorship and part of the
        mentorship was to work on a project with my mentor Amy. After bouncing some ideas around we collectively decided
        that the blog was the best project to do as I was going to do one anyway and we thought of some features that
        would make it more interesting and less front end-y which you will be seeing in due course! </p>
